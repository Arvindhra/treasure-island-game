# treasure-island-game
A simple game to find treasure in a mystical land based on the choices you make. 

This game can only be played on the Python IDE terminal for now.

I will try to see if I can incorporate HTML and CSS into this code in the future to enable a general user to play this game.

This game is part of practice from Day 3 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Angela Yu.
